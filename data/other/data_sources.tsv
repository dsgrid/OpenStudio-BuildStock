Geometry Shared Walls	OpenStreetMap building footprint data. April 2018.	"Queried by Radiant Labs: 1) Find longest shared wall direction e.g. N. 2) If shared length >0.5 of the total length for that direction, continue, otherwise, assign as ""Detached"". 3) Calculate opposite shared walls e.g. S, SE, SW. If any over 0.5, assign as ""Middle"", otherwise assign as ""End"". 4) Calculate perpendicular shared walls e.g. E and W. If both over 0.5, or one is plus middle, assign as ""Three sides"", otherwise ""Corner"". Mapping={'Detached':'None','End'*0.5:'Left','End'*0.5:'Right','Middle':'LeftRight','Corner'*0.5:'LeftBack','Corner'*0.5:'LeftRight'}"
