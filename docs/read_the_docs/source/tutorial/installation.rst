Installation

Download the ResStock repository
================================

Go to the `releases page on GitHub <https://github.com/NREL/resstock/releases>`_, select a release, and either ``git clone`` or download a zip of the repository. The ``master`` branch is under active development, so we recommend using the latest `release <https://github.com/NREL/resstock/releases>`_ for production runs.

Developer instructions
======================

If you will be developing residential measures and testing residential building models, see the :ref:`advanced_tutorial`. If you are a developer, make sure that you have checked out the ``master`` branch of the repository.
